# *Dendrobates auratus* transcriptome

This repository is for a project examining differential gene expression between different color morphs of the green and black poison frog, *Dendrobates auratus*.

Transcriptome assembly, read cleaning, and transcript expression quantification is all done in bash. Subsequent differential gene expression analyses are in the R markdown file.
